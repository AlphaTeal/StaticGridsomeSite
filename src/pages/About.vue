    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Nice of you to drop by! My name is Joseph Gore, but you can call me Joey. I'm currently working full time as a software engineer for <a href="https://www.infoscitex.com/">InfoSciTex</a> in Dayton, OH. I'm taking classes towards a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Dayton at night. In my free time, I enjoy working on personal software projects, playing PC and Nintendo Switch games, and spending time with my friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have over 4 years of academic experience in computer software and hardware, and over 2 years of professional software engineering experience. I am looking forward to many more years of learning and growth!
