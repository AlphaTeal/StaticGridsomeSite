Hello world! This is primarily a test of the blog functionality of my website. Here I will be posting blog posts primarily relating to software development; specifically web development. My goals with this website are:

- Increase my visibility in the software development community
- Share interesting things and contribute to the body of knowledge with my blog
- Have fun!

I hope to make many improvements to this website in the near future. Too many improvements to list here! So thank you for reading, and I hope you stick around!
